# Feature

Currently when a player selects a card, the test "You selected: ?" is displayed and the card is displayed with the face down next to the players name.

A change is requested that the currently selected card is displayed with a different background and the card is displayed face down next to the players name. the text "You selected: ?" will vanish.

It is also possible for player to change his decision as long as the cards have not yet been revealed. Clicking on a card which has been selected will unselect it and it is treated as if the player has not made a decision yet.
