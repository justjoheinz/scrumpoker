# Moderator Feature

I need support for a new feature. When a player is asked for his name when joining a room, the player should also be asked whether the player wants to be a moderator in this room (via a checkbox).

A player who is not a moderator will behave as before. no changes result in non moderator players.

# Moderator

if a player is a moderator in a room, then 
1. his name will not be visible in the player list 
2. he will not see the card selector
3. But he will be able to use the buttons for Game reset and Card reveal.

In fact guiding the other plyers by revealing cards and resetting the game state is the task for the moderator.

# Open issues

Currently all players can be removed from the room by all other players (removal button). If a moderator is not in the player list, how can he be removed?
